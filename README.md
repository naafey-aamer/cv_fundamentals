# cv_fundamentals
Incremental implementation of the fundamentals of Computer Vision

## Overview
This repository aims to be an educative resource covering interactive implementations of the founding concepts of Computer Vision taught in **CS5613: Computer Vision Fundamentals** at LUMS, Pakistan.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages with:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Vanishing Point
Vanishing points refer to the points in a perspective image where parallel lines appear to converge or intersect. They are the foundation of projective geometry and play a major role in understanding the spatial relationships between objects in a scene, aiding in tasks like object detection, 3D reconstruction, and image rectification.

The code provided in the folder "vanishing point" utilizes Tkinter for the GUI, and OpenCV for image handling. Here's a brief overview of how to interact with it:

1. **Run "_main.py"** and a window should pop up with an "upload file" button. Upload an image and it should appear something like this:
